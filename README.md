### Petnavi

I'm just a SWE student beginning their first steps in a career change. This is where I'll be throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks. Currently finishing up my degree, got 1 to 1.5 years left and then it'll be time to go through the HR boss and get rejected a billion times. I also really like Absols, so have one on me.
